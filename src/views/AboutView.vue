    <p>Hello, Iâ€™m Pauline Wahle - user experience designer and frontend developer.
Coming from a degree in graphic design, and a following degree focusing on digital spaces with studies in user experience and front-end development, I draw from a wholistic view on design, usability and technology. Always considering the usability aspect, I find it fascinating to explore and reimagine digital spaces in new ways that surprise, simplify and create lasting impressions. By taking opportunities to establish original ideas, each design can get a unique look and feel. My basis for both design and development is creative thinking, to stay flexible, keep moving and find alternative paths.
